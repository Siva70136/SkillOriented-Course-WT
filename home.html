		Legends are always re-born . . .
A consummate classic is timeless. <br>It’s always right at home, no matter where it goes. Meet the new Jawa.
With its polished chrome and retro curves,<br> the Jawa combines nostalgic class and modern engineering for a timeless look and a ride like no other. Uncompromising build quality from premium Italian engineering means the 50s design is every bit as rugged and reliable as the classics.

MotoFest 2021 is coming up and legendary former Kiwi international Aaron Slight is one man who simply can't wait for it to begin.
<br><br>
It will no doubt be another classic weekend at Hampton Downs Motorsport Park, when the popular north Waikato race track hosts the fourth annual Mike Pero MotoFest on the weekend of March 6-7, world-renowned Masterton personality Slight looking forward to having another opportunity to ride the rare Proton KR3 bike during the "Legends Parade" segment of the jam-packed weekend.
<br><br>
The programme for MotoFest 2021 will feature the second annual Motul NZ Classic Grand Prix, the Shoei Helmets-sponsored Classic Two Stroke races and will also stage the third round of four in the New Zealand Superbike Championships (NZSBK) and, with so much going on, it's likely spectators won't know which way to look.
